# Simple-mad-libs-game-in-c
A simple begginer project for fun learning, and practicing coding in c.
The game asks the player for different types of words (adjectives, nouns, verbs, etc.) and then inserts them into a fun story template.  
The result is a silly and personalized story generated from the playerâ€™s own input.

---

## ðŸŽ® How It Works
1. The program greets you and explains the game.
2. You will be asked to enter:
   - 7 adjectives  
   - 1 city and 2 other places  
   - A friendâ€™s name  
   - A food  
   - An animal  
   - 1 plural noun and 1 singular noun  
   - 1 verb, 1 past tense verb, and 1 verb ending with *-ing*  
3. After entering all the words, the program prints out your unique story.


## ðŸš€ Future Improvements

  - Add multiple story templates
  - Randomly select a template for variety
  - Allow the player to generate a new story without restarting the program
